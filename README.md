# Machine Learning Engineering Assignment

This assignment is expected to be completed by a Machine Learning Engineer within 3-4 hours.

### Assignment:

Your teammate Mike gave you a Machine Learning Model that needs to be deployed, examine the model.py file. 
Your task is to add the necessary components to get this model to production, 
this model is crucial for the company's success, so it should be available receive and predict data upon request.
This model should work for any cloud provider. Also this is the model v1 of a series of versions to be deployed.
(Optional): you can come up with a better model pipeline if you think the one provided is not suitable for this case.

Add all the necessary files, code, docs, to improve this repository and make this model ready to be shipped.

Note: You can reach out to us through email at marcos.soto@qubika.com or anibal.jasin@qubika.com but since
you could be working off hours we suggest you can write down questions and assumptions you came across
and what decision you take e.g. “I’m gonna assume this project should have X because of Y” or 
“I would ask about if there is some ACL for this model, so I would assume X”.

Some general considerations and guidance:

- It is expected that you include files, code, documentation, and any other resources you find useful in the new repository you create.
- A fully production-ready model deployed in the cloud is not required.
- You are not expected to spend money on cloud services, ensuring everything works locally is sufficient.
- It is acceptable if some aspects are not fully functional, our goal is to understand your approach to this problem.
- In case you don’t finish the assignment, you can add what other things you would do in the README.md.
